# A7

The goal of this project was to perform an analysis to answer three primary research questions:

1. How masking policies changed the progression of confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 1, 2020 through October 15, 2021?

2. What is the relationship between Covid-19 infection rate and unemployment rate in Baltimore County?

3. What is the relationship between Covid-19 infection rate and crime reports in Baltimore County?



The tables in the raw data file are as follows:

- unemployment




Limitations

The most significant limitation I faced in my analysis was the lack of publicly available granular data for both crime reports and unemployment rate. While I had daily data for both Covid-19 cases and whether a masking mandate was in effect, I could only find monthly data for crime reports and unemployment rate in Baltimore County. Due to this lack of data, I was unable to find significant relationships and further analysis would be needed to draw more accurate conclusions. Even when using the weekly data from the state of Maryland, it only included unemployment rate of those on unemployment benefits, a limitation as it didnâ€™t include all those unemployed.
I was also unable to make comparisons across 2020 and 2021 for crime reports due to changes in reporting. This made it hard to measure the effect of Covid-19 infection rate on crime report count as the pandemic went on, as I could only look into one year at a time. Additionally, there was no credible information on crime report counts from before 2020 that I could access to attempt to understand the baseline for crime report counts before the pandemic started.
Another limitation is the assumption I made in each analysis of there being no confounding factors. For instance, when I investigated mask mandate vs Covid-19 infection rate I assumed mask mandates were the only factors that could be affecting infection rate, while in reality many other factors are at play including vaccinations and social distancing. While there were no other factors considered, I believe some meaningful conclusions can still be drawn just from looking at these two factors in my analysis.
